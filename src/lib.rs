//! Native Rust VMs for Quake 3
//!
//! The [id Tech 3 engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_3)
//! can load its game modules (`qagame`, `cgame` and `ui`) both as
//! QVM (Quake Virtual Machine, see [`quake3-qvm` crate](https://crates.io/crates/quake3-qvm)) files and
//! as shared libraries.
//! This crate enables you to write such a native module with Rust code. For those, (Q)VM is
//! a misnomer, since they are not interpreted/compiled with the engine's machinery.
//!
//! Take a look at [`native_vm!`](native_vm) to get started.
